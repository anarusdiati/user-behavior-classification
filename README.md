# User Behavior Classification
Predict whether a user session will result in a conversion based on behavioral signals. 

This project focuses on predicting user purchase intent based on behavioral signals collected during online shopping sessions. The goal is to demonstrate how machine learning can support user-centric product decisions while maintaining a privacy-conscious approach.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Understanding user intent early allows digital products to improve user experience without relying on intrusive personal data.



<h2>ML Task</h2>

- Supervised Learning
- Binary Classification

<h2>Business Relevance</h2>
Early prediction of user intent enables better UX personalization and decision-making without intrusive data collection.

<h2>Dataset</h2>

Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset ([UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset) / [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henrysue/online-shoppers-intention))

<h2>Methodology</h2>

- Logistic Regression (as baseline)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost / LightGBM
- SHAP (for interpretability)

<h2>Metrics for Evaluation</h2>
